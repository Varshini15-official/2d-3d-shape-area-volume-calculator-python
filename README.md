## 🧩 Project Overview

This project provides a user-friendly interface to:

- Calculate **area** for various 2D geometric figures.
- Calculate **volume** for different 3D solids.
- Visualize the shapes interactively on canvas for better understanding.
- Support rotation for 3D shapes to view from different angles (for some solids).

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Run the main script (`main.py` or equivalent).
2. Choose between **2D Figures** or **3D Figures** from the main menu.
3. Select the desired shape from the options presented.
4. Enter the required dimensions (radius, side, height, angles, etc.).
5. Click **Calculate** to get the area or volume.
6. View the shape drawn or rotated on the canvas.
7. Close or navigate back to calculate for another shape.
